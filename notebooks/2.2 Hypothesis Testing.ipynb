    "## 1. Hypothesis Testing and p-values\n",

    "Suppose that we partition the parameter space $\\Theta$ into two disjoint sets $\\Theta_0$ and $\\Theta_1$ and that we wish to test\n",

    "$$ H_0 : \\theta \\in \\Theta_0 \\quad \\text{versus} \\quad H_1 : \\theta \\in \\Theta_1. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We call $H_0$ the **null hypothesis** and $H_1$ the **alternative hypothesis**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ be a random variable and let $\\mathcal{X}$ be the range of $X$. We test a hypothesis by finding an appropriate subset of outcomes $R \\subset \\mathcal{X}$ called the **rejection region**. If $X \\in R$ we reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, we do not reject the null hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "X \\in R &\\implies \\text{reject } H_0 \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ R = \\Big\\{ x : T(x) > c \\Big\\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T$ is a **test statistic** and $c$ is a **critical value**. The problem in hypothesis testing is to find an appropriate test statistic $T$ and an  appropriate critical value $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reporting \"reject $H_0$\" or \"retain $H_0$\" is not very informative. Instead, we could ask, for every $\\alpha$, whether the test rejects at that level. Generally, if the test rejects at level $\\alpha$ it will also reject at level $\\alpha' > \\alpha$. Hence, there is a smallest $\\alpha$ at which the test rejects and we call this number the $p$-value.\n",

    "### 2.1 $z$-Test\n",
    "\n",
    "$z$-tests are a statistical way of testing a hypothesis when we know the population standard deviation $\\sigma$. We use them when we wish to compare the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ to the population mean $\\mu$. However, if your sample size is large, $n \\geq 30$, then you can still use $z$-tests without knowing the population standard deviation. Instead, you may use the sample standard deviation as an estimate of the population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditions for using this type of test are that the data must be **normally distributed**; all data points must be **independent**; and for each sample the **standard deviations must be equal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic is computed using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ z = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{x}$ denotes the sample mean, $\\mu$ is the population mean, $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example of a $z$-test on a one-sample two-tailed distribution from Roland (2021). Suppose we aim to investigate whether a drug has an impact on IQ. Assuming our population mean $\\mu = 100$ and population standard deviation $\\sigma = 15$, we conduct a study involving a sample of $100$ subjects. Upon analysis, we discover that the mean IQ of the sample is $96$. Determine whether the drug has a significant influence on IQ values at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$."

This is why it is better to use nonparametric methods whenever possible rather than relying on parametric assumptions."
