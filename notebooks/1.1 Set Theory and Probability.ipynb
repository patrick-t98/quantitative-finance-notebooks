    "### 1.1 The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "A **set** is a collection of objects (elements). For example, a set containing the numbers 1, 2, 3 would be written as \\{1 ,2, 3\\}, which we can name as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To express symbolically that an element belongs to a set we use $\\in$, and, to express that it does not belong we use $\\notin$. For example, if $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, then $1 \\in A, 2 \\in A$, but $4 \\notin A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, we do not write out all the elements in a set but will write a shorthand description using **set builder notation**. For example, the set of prime numbers could be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = \\{p \\mid p \\text{ is a prime} \\}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = \\{p \\colon p \\text{ is a prime} \\}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $p$ is a variable which must satisfy some criterion we call the **predicate**, since its belonging to the set is predicated on some criterion. In this case, the predicate is being a prime number, so we can read the above equation as \"$p$ such that $p$ is a prime\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**Two sets are equal** if they both contain the **same elements**. For example, if $a \\in A$, $a \\in B$ and for all $b \\in B, b \\in A$, then $A = B$. This definition means that the order of the elements does not matter, we only need to show that they share the same elements. It also does not matter if elements are repeated, as long as every element in one set can be shown to be in the other we still have equality. Generally, we just write the elements in a way that's easiest to read, which usually means without repetitions and in some sensible order. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **size** or **cardinality** of a set is the number of elements it contains. For example, the cardinality of $A$ is $|A| = 3 $. If a set has an infinite set of elements, like the $P = \\{p \\colon p \\text{ is a prime} \\}$, its perfectly fine to write $|P| = \\infty$."

We write $A \\subseteq B$ to denote that \"$A$ is a subset of $B$\". Remember: **subsets are always sets themselves**. So in our example, 4 is an element of $B$, but it is not a subset of $B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important property is that all sets are subsets of themselves. We can take this further to give a different definition of **set equality**. If $A \\subseteq B$ and $B \\subseteq A$ then $A = B$. An example to go along with the image below would be if $A = \\{ 2, 4, 6 \\}$ and $B = \\{ 6, 4, 2 \\}$\n",
